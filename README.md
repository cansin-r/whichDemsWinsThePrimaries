Final Project for Data, Inference, Prediction (DATA 102) at UC Berkeley. 
## Research Question 1
Does party support CAUSE democratic nominees to win the primary elections?
After performing exploratory data analysis on the democratic candidates dataset, we detected some confounding variables.
We then include these confounding variables in our Least Squares Regression in order to understand the effect of party support on primary outcomes.
## Research Question 2
Logistic Regression vs. Decision Tree Classification when predicting Democratic Primary Election results using personal information about candidates.
